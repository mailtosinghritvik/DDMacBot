# DDMac Bot - Excel Intake and RAG Workflow Implementation

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION - UPDATED WITH DEDICATED ASSISTANTS

### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Excel File Processing**
   - `process_excel_file()` - Reads all sheets from uploaded Excel files
   - Handles multiple sheet types (xlsx, xls, csv)
   - Error handling for corrupt or unreadable files

2. **User Context Collection**
   - `collect_sheet_info_simple()` - Collects user-provided context for each Excel sheet
   - Simple UI with meaning and description fields for each sheet
   - Validation to ensure all sheets have context before proceeding

3. **Markdown Generation with RAG Chunking**
   - `generate_markdown_from_excel()` - Converts Excel data to structured markdown
   - **Context markers every 1000 characters** for optimal RAG chunking
   - Includes project metadata, sheet descriptions, and data summaries
   - Handles large tables by chunking into manageable sections
   - Preserves data relationships and context

4. **Vector Store Integration**
   - `upload_to_vector_store()` - Uploads generated markdown to main vector store
   - Uses OpenAI's vector store API for seamless integration
   - Proper error handling and status reporting
   - Integrates with existing RAG system (Vector Store ID: `vs_qUspcB7VllWXM4z7aAEdIK9L`)

5. **üÜï DEDICATED ASSISTANT CREATION PER FILE**
   - `create_assistant_with_excel()` - Creates a NEW Assistant for each uploaded file
   - **Each Assistant has `code_interpreter` tool enabled**
   - **Excel file is attached directly to the Assistant's tool resources**
   - **Project-specific instructions and context** embedded in Assistant description
   - **Assistant can run Python code on the Excel data** for advanced analysis
   - Returns Assistant ID, Thread ID, and File ID for tracking

6. **Real-time Chat Integration**
   - **Floating chat widget** connects directly to the DEDICATED Assistant
   - Users can ask for **detailed analysis, calculations, and visualizations**
   - Assistant has **full code execution capabilities** on the uploaded Excel
   - **Each project gets its own specialized AI assistant**
   - Live Q&A with polling for Assistant responses

7. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Real-time progress tracking during processing
   - Project summary display after completion
   - Download and preview options for generated markdown
   - **Assistant ID and Thread ID display** for tracking
   - Status indicators for vector store and dedicated Assistant

### Session State Management:
- `thread_id` - Tracks created Assistant thread
- `file_id` - Tracks uploaded Excel file in Assistant
- `markdown_content` - Stores generated markdown for download/preview
- `vector_upload_success` - Tracks vector store upload status
- `floating_chat_messages` - Manages chat conversation history
- `floating_chat_open` - Controls chat widget visibility

### Configuration Required:
- `VECTOR_STORE_ID` - Your OpenAI vector store ID
- `ASSISTANT_ID` - Your OpenAI Assistant ID
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (environment variable)

## üîÑ WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

1. **User uploads Excel file** on Home page
2. **System processes Excel** and displays all sheets
3. **User provides context** for each sheet (meaning/description)
4. **AI processing pipeline begins:**
   - Creates Assistant thread and uploads Excel file
   - Generates chunked markdown with context markers
   - Uploads markdown to main vector store
   - Stores all metadata in session state
5. **User can immediately:**
   - Chat with Assistant about the specific Excel file
   - Query the main vector store through existing chat system
   - Download/preview the generated markdown
   - View project analytics in dashboard

## üéØ KEY BENEFITS

- **Dual Access Pattern**: File available in both Assistant thread (original Excel) and vector store (processed markdown)
- **Context-Aware Chunking**: Every 1000 characters with project/company/file context
- **Real-time Chat**: Immediate Q&A about uploaded files
- **No Data Loss**: Original Excel preserved in Assistant, processed data in vector store
- **Project-Centric**: All processing tied to specific project/company metadata

## üöÄ USAGE

1. Upload AccuBid Excel file
2. Fill in company/project information
3. Provide context for each Excel sheet
4. Click "Continue with AI Processing"
5. Use floating chat widget for immediate questions
6. Navigate to Chat page for broader vector store queries

## üìù TECHNICAL NOTES

- Uses OpenAI Assistants API for file-specific chat
- Integrates with existing vector store for RAG queries
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing chat system
- Error handling for API failures and file processing issues
- Session state persistence across page interactions
